# FRaaS-Postman
Based on requirements of [FRaaS Developer Docs](http://developer-cloud.forgerock.com).

JSON files with current Postman Scripts / Environments.

We created this repo for Postman Users on Linux / Windows systems, as the "Run in Postman" option works only on Macs. In addition, this repo provides configuration and version control. 

You should be able to import the latest `collection` and `environment` JSON files. We have tested imports of these files solely into [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).
